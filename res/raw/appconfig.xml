Kathy: How many hours a day do you study?

Sandy: About five or six hours a day, plus classes.

Kathy: Do you study at the library?

Sandy: At the library and in my room. I like to listen to the radio when I study. I can't listen to the radio in the library. So I study in my room as much as possible.

Kathy: What do you listen to on the radio?

Sandy: Mostly music. But there is one problem.

Kathy: What's that?

Sandy: My roommate Jake. Jake can't study with the radio on. He likes quiet. So I have to turn off the radio when Jake wants to study.

Kathy: A radio play?

Pat: Yes, we're going to perform it on our university radio station.

Kathy: Is it difficult to act in a radio play?

Pat: Well, it's different from stage acting. When the audience watches a stage play, they can see and hear the actors on the stage. But in a radio play, the audience can only listen. They have to use their imaginations. Let me give you an example. Listen to these sounds:

SFX: footsteps

Kathy: Footsteps. I hear footsteps. I hear someone walking.

SFX: knocking

Kathy: Someone is knocking... knocking on a door. I hear someone knocking on a door.

SFX: door opening

Kathy: The door is opening. I hear someone opening the door.

SFX: footsteps, getting louder

Old man: Hello...? Is anybody home?

Kathy: It sounds like an old man... a very old man.

Pat: That's right.

Blake: I call it "Winter."

Kent: Ah...I see... the black lines look like trees in winter, trees with no leaves.

Blake: Yes. That's right.

Kent: And this painting over here, with a lot of red, pink and green. These shapes look like... flowers. Is this... "Spring"?

Blake: Right again! It's called "Spring."

Kent: And, of course, this one with lots of brown, orange and yellow... It's "Fall," isn't it?

Blake: Yes, "Fall."

Kent: And this one... let's see... there's a large red... uh, shape, and over here... these look like bright green grapes...

Blake: Well... actually...

Kent: No, no, don't tell me! It's "Summer," isn't it?

				<viewscript>Kathy: Our guest today is Mike Johnson. Mike was born in Mississippi and grew up in Atlanta, Georgia. Mike, I'd like to ask you a question.

Mike: Sure.

Kathy: What was it like, growing up in the South?

Mike: Well, Atlanta is a great city. And for an African-American family like ours, it was a great city to grow up in. We lived in a small house in a nice neighborhood. Some of our neighbors were African American, and some were white. We all got along very well together.

Kathy: Things changed a lot in the South during the 1960's and 1970's, didn't they?

Mike: Yes, they did. When my father was growing up, things were very different. He was born in Mississippi in 1939. At that time, life was very hard for African Americans. By the time we moved to Atlanta, things were better. But even today, there still is racial prejudice in America.

Kathy: Martin Luther King, Jr. was born in Atlanta, wasn't he?

				<viewscript>Kathy: We're talking with Martha Harris about her husband and her marriage. Martha, may I ask, how did you meet your husband?

Martha:	Oh, that's a funny story. I was working in a grocery store. Let's see...  This was in 1943. At the time, I was living in New York City. Well, one day, a young man walked into the store. He took an orange from the table... ...and all the other oranges rolled onto the floor. There were oranges everywhere! Well, everyone in the store was picking up oranges. And we were all laughing.

Kathy: Yes.

Martha: Well, after we put the all oranges back, he and I began to talk.

Kathy: Unh huh.

Martha:	And the next week, we went to a movie together. That was... June... June 1943. We got engaged two months later, in August.

Kathy: When did you get married?

Martha: We got married about a year later. In March, 1944.

Kathy: Nineteen forty-four?

Martha: Yes. That was a long time ago.</viewscript>

Kent: Are you here to learn more about President Roosevelt?

Woman: I want to learn more about Mrs. Roosevelt.
